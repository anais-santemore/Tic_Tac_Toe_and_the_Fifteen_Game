# A Math Lesson in Two Games
Learn about proof and how math can help us see when two problems that seem different on their surfaces are really the same underneath.

## Tic Tac Toe
Can you write a thorough proof that one player or the other has a winning strategy in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe?
In this React app version of the classic game you can get three in a row to win against another person or my bot, 
as long as you don't play in hard mode! You can even get tips from an interactive coach and see a complete solution 
to the game as color-coded hints. 

## The Fifteen Game
Try to collect three cards that add up to Fifteen.  If my bot keeps getting the best of you it may help to take a look at 
three by three Magic Squares.  Then you will see that this unfamiliar game is actually just Tic-Tac-Toe in disguise.
